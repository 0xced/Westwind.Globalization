#West Wind Globalization
###Datadriven resource localization for .NET applications###
This library provides a SQL Server driven localization engine that can be
plugged into any application. The application uses standard .NET ResourceSets
and ResourceManagers with a generic data backend to feed resource sets and
provide edit and update capabilities to localization resources stored in a
database. 

Requirements:
* .NET 4.5
* Sql Server, Sql Express or SQL CE 4 or later

###Under Construction###
This is is an update to the original Westwind.Globalization library that
was focused primarily on Web Forms. The new library is more generic and 
provides better support for direct access in ASP.NET MVC, Web API and 
any other type of .NET application.

The current version is pre-release and still in Flux. The code is
fully functional and production ready, but currently samples and 
documentation are not in place. This realease is primarily a preview
for those that have provided feedback and were looking for the specific
improvements and enhancements provided by the new version.

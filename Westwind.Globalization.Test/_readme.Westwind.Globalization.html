    <h1>Westwind Globalization Configuration</h1>
    
    <article class="contentcontainer" style="margin: 30px">
        <p>
            The NuGet package installs all the required assemblies and configures most
            web.config configuration settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following settings are made automatically when you install with the NuGet
            package, but here are the manual configuration instructions just in case.
        </p>

        <b>Configuration Section Name declaration:</b>

        <pre>&lt;configsections&gt;
        &lt;section name=&quot;DbResourceProvider&quot;
                 type=&quot;Westwind.Globalization.DbResourceProviderSection,Westwind.Globalization&quot;
                 requirepermission=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/configsections&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            manually edit the connection string that points at the database that will contain the
            localization table. This table will be auto-created for you when the globalization resources
            are accessed or you are running the localization admin form. Please make sure that the database
            has appropriate rights to create a table.
        </p>


        <h3>Resource Provider is enabled by default</h3>
        <p>
            Once the NuGet package has been installed the provider is immediately enabled with:
        </p>

        <pre>&lt;globalization resourceproviderfactorytype=&quot;Westwind.Globalization.DbSimpleResourceProviderFactory,Westwind.Globalization&quot; /&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            If you are using Resx resources currently this will likely cause your resources to fail and if so you'll
            want to uncomment the line above in web.config and first import resources into the resource table. Once
            imported you can then turn on the new resource provider.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started with Localization</h3>

        <p><b>If you have no resources in your project</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to ./LocalizationAdmin/LocalizationAdmin.aspx</li>
            <li>Use the Create Table button to create the resource for the database</li>
            <li>Import resources from project (this will import Resx resources for the Admin form)</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>To create new Resources</b></p>

        <p>
            Click on the New icon next to the resource list list. This will let you add a new resource set.
            Resource names map to .NET ResourceSets, so these are groupings of files resources that are
            associated. Typically you'll have at least one <i>Resources</i> file that holds common
            localizations, plus some UI specific Resources that map either to screens or related UI
            elements/screens. These resources are considered **Global Resources** by ASP.NET.
        </p>
        <p>
            In WebForms projects you can also create **Local Resources** which are bound to ASPX
            pages typically. Local resources can be used in Web Forms using the Resource Binding
            syntax available there. Local resources are named by their full path (ie. relativePath/Page.aspx).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also create Resources implicitly simply by adding a new resource and specifying a
            new Resource name in the Add Resource form. Simply specify the language, Resource Id,
            localized text and the Resource name and that effectively creates a new ResourceSet.
        </p>

        <div class="notebox">
            <b>New Resource Sets or new Language Resources require a Page Refresh</b><br />
            The LocalizationAdmin form uses inline AJAX requests for quick updates, but when adding a new resource set or
            resource item with a new language you have to press the Refresh Page button to see the
            new resource set and language show up in the dialog. The Resources and Language lists
            do not dynamically update when items are saved, so a manual refresh is required.
        </div>

        <p>
            Note this resource editing scheme works for any resources and type of project including
            MVC projects with raw RESX files.
        </p>

        <h3>Importing ASP.NET Resources using Visual Studio</h3>

        <p>
            You can also import resources using the Visual Studio designer using the standard localization
            tools - ASSUMING THE PROVIDER IS WORKING in your project. Use Tools | Generate Local Resources
            to generate any local resources for localizable controls on a given ASPX page. When you do
            resources will be imported into the database and you can use the Web resource editor to edit
            your resources interactively.
        </p>

        <h3>Importing exising ResX Resources</h3>

        <p>
            If you have existing ResX resources you can import them from your project using the Import
            button on the localization admin form. This should make all your existing resources available
            in the resource editor.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you choose at a later point you can also export your resources from the database back into
            Resx resources.
